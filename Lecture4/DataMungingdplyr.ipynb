    "Data rarely arrives in the form we need for analysis. In fact, it is has been estimated that data scientists spend 80% of their time preparing data (some say [the other 20% is spent complaining about preparing data:)](https://twitter.com/bigdataborat/status/306596352991830016?lang=en). This process of integrating and filtering data is commonly know as data munging. \n",

    "This notebook contains exercises in using dplyr for data munging. The R dplyr package contains a widely used, powerful, flexible and efficient set of functions for data munging. Further, dplyr uses a regular gramar for defining complex data munging pipelines. "
