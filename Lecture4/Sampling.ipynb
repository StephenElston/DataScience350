    "\n",
    "Sampling is a fundamental process in the collection of data. Sampling is important because we can almost never look at the whole population. Some key points to keep in mind about sampling are:\n",
    "- We use inferences on the sample to say something about the population.\n",
    "- We need estimates of variances on the sample calculations to say something about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples of sampling.\n",

    "| Use Case | Sample | Population |\n",

    "Notice, that in several cases it is not only impractical, but impossible to collect data from the entire population. Hence, we must work with correctly collected samples. \n",

If the real world did not follow this theorem much of statistics, to say nothing of science and technology would fail badly. \n",
