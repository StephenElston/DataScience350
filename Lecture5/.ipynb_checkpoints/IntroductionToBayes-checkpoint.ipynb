    "## Brief history\n",
    "\n",
    "A restricted version of Bayes Theorem was proposed by Rev.Thomas Bayes (1702-1761). Bayes Theorem, was published postumously by his friend Richard Price. Bayes' interest was in probabilities of gambling games. He was also a supporter of Isac Newton's new theory of calculus, with his publication, &An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/ThomasBayes.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "A version of Bayes Theorem which in its modern form was published by Pierre-Simon Laplace in Essai philosophique sur les probabilités 1814. Laplace applied Baysian methods to problems in celestial mechanics. These problems had great practical implicatons in the late 18th and early 19th centuries for the safe navigaton of ships. \n",

    "![](img/Laplace.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The geophysicist and mathemtician Harold Jefferys extensively used Bayes' methods. His 1939 book, *The Theory of Probability* was in deliberate opposition to Fisher's methods using p-values.\n",

    "![](img/JeffreysProbability.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispite the philosophical squables, Baysian methods endured and showed an increasing number of success stories. Pragmatists continued to use both approaches. A number of success during the Second World War, with the philosophical battles raging, included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian models were used to improve artillery accuracy in both world wars. In particular the Soviet statistian Kolmagorov used Bayes methods to greatly improve artillery accuracy. \n",
    "- Bayesian models used by Alan Turing to break German codes.\n",
    "- Bernard Koopman, working for the British Royal Navy, improved the ability to locate U-boats using directional data from intercepted radio transmissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the second half of the 20th century the convergance of greater computing power and general acceptance lead to the following notable advances in computational Baysian methods.\n",

    "## Baysian vs. Frequentist Views\n",
    "\n",
    "The battle between Fisher, Jefferys and their protégés continued for most of the 20th century. This battle was bitter and often personal. The core of these argument were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fisher argued that the selection of a Bayesian prior distribution was purely subjective, allowing one to achieve any answer desired.\n",
    "- Jefferys argued that all knowledge is in fact subjective, and that choosing a confidence interval was subjective in any event.\n",
    "\n",
    "With greater compuational power and general acceptance, Bayes methods are now widely used in areas ranging from medical research to natural language understanding to web search. Amoung pragmatists, the common belief today is that some problems are better handled by Frequentist methods and some with Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize the differences between the Baysian and Frequentist views. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian methods use priors to quantify what we know about parameters.\n",
    "- Frequentists do not quantify anything about the parameters, using p-values and confidence intervals to express the unknowns about parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling that both views are useful, we can contrast these methods with a chart.\n",

    "The choice of the prior is a serious problem when performing Bayesian analysis.In general, a prior must be convincing to a **sceptical audience**. Some possible approches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior observations\n",
    "- Domain knowledge\n",
    "- If poor knowledge use less informative prior\n",
    "- **Watch out:** A uniform prior is informative. For exampe, you must set the limits on range of values\n",
    " \n",
    "One analytically and compuationally simple choice is a **conjugate prior**. When a likelihood is multiplied by a conjugate prior the distribution of the postirior is the same as the likelihood. Most named distributions have conjugates. A few commonly used eamples are shown in the table below:\n",

    "- Add more data to our data set to updated the posterior distribution.\n",

    "The posterior distribution in binomially distributed. We can write this formally for $k$ successes in $N$ trials:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A) = \\binom{N}{k} \\cdot p^kq^{N-k}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Choosing a prior\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step in this analysis is to choose a prior distribution. Since our likelihood distribution is binomial, we will start with the conjugate Beta distribution. Formally, we can write the Beta distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Beta(p |a, b) = \\kappa x^{a-1}(1 - x)^{b-1} \\\\\n",
    "where,\\ \\kappa = normalization\\ constant$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Beta distribution is define on the interval $0 \\le Beta(p|a,b) \\le 1$. The Beta distribution has two parameters, a and b, which determine the shape. To get a feel for the Beta distribution, exectute the code in the cell below which computes 100 examples on a 10x10 grid. "
