    "The Central Limit Theorm is a fundamental relationship which underpins many of principles which make statistical methods work. Put another way, without the Central Limit Theorm much of what we do rountinely would simply not work. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CLT enables sampling methods\n",
    "- Without a CLT we could not reliably compute confidence intervals\n",
    "- Most statistical methods and machine learning algorithms rely on CLT. For example, Hypothesis tests rest on the CLT\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "The CLT has been around in many forms and was refined for two centuries. The first published version was by de Moiver in 1738. He proved a special case for bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/deMoiver.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplace published generalization of the CLT in 1776, 1785 and 1820. A rigorous proof of a version close to the modern form was published by Chebyshev in 1887. Feller and Lévy worked on genralizations and some special cases into the mid 1930s. \n"
