    "Let's start by enumerating all of the possible end states from throwing two dice. We will assume that these dice are 'fair'.  In other words, the chance there is an equal probability that any face of the dice will land pointing up. In terms of probability, we say that the distribution of scores for each die follows a **Uniform distribution**. further, we assume that the dice are indentical and that the score for each dice is not dependent on the other dice. In the terminology of probability, we can now say that the score of each dice is **Independent Identically Distributed**, or **iid**.  \n",

We have already investigate an example of a discrete process when we examined the outcome of dice throws. Each die lands with a certain side up and the sum of the two numbers is the total score. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete distribution the probability of an event, A, is the number of ways A can occur, divided by the number of total possible outcomes in our Sample Space, S. Let's make this concrete with an example. In the figure below there are 10 events in S, 6 in set A, and 4 in set B.\n",

    "The long running television game show, *Let's Make A Deal*, created and hosted by *Monte Hall*, had its hay day in the 1970s. At the finally of the show, Monte would tell the winning contestant that she could pick a one of three doors. Behind one door there would be a valuable prize like a car. Worthless itemes, like a goat, were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant would pick a door. At this point Monte would build suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monte knew which door had the valuable prize, and would always reveal one of the worthless prizes. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors. The question then is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice. The figure below illustrates the situation the contestant faces if they pick Door 1:\n",

She was then ridiculed by several statisticians. \n",
