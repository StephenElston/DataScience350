    "Let's start by enumerating all of the possible end states from throwing two dice. We will assume that these dice are 'fair'.  In other words, the chance there is an equal probability that any face of the dice will land pointing up. In terms of probability, we say that the distribution of scores for each die follows a **Uniform distribution**. further, we assume that the dice indentical and that the score for each dice is not dependent on the other dice. In the terminology of probability, we can now say that the score of each dice is **Independent Identically Distributed**, or **iid**.  \n",

Worthless itemes, like a goat, were placed behind the other two doors. The contestant would pick a door. At this point Monte would build suspense by opening one of the other doors. Monte knew which door had the valuable prize, and would always reveal one of the worthless prizes. He would then tell the contestant that they could change their choice of doors. The question then is, should the contestant switch or stick with their original choice. The figure below illustrates the situation the contestant faces if they pick Door 1:\n",
