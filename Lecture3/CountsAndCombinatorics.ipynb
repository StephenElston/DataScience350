    "In this notebook we will explore count data and combinatorics. Event data is typically analyzed as counts for the number of each type of event that occurs. Determining the number of possible outcomes is key to computing the chances of an event occuring. This branch of mathematics is known as **combinatorics**.\n",

    "Combinatorics of the biggest areas of mathematics. We apply combinatorics to compute the possible combinations or permutations of an combinationn of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use combinatorics to compute the number of possible sandwiches we can order at a sandwich shop with a limited menu, 4 bread choices, 5 meat choices, 4 toppings.  How many sandwich unique sandwich combination can we order by picking  one item from each category?   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$4 * 5 * 4 = 80$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that for this problem we just need to multiple the number of choices for each class. This is an example of the **multiplication principle** of combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example there is no dependncy of our choice from one category to anyother. Consequently, we can find all of the possible combinations by simple multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always the case. Let's look at an example where each event changes the subsequent possible events. Let's say I go to a pub and I want to order a 4-beer taster, with each beer being unique. The pub has 10 beers on tap. How many possible choices do I have for my taster? Fortunately I know python, so I can use the python `itertools.combinations` fuction to build a table of all possible combinations of my 4-beer taster!"
